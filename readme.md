## Description
This course is an introduction to digital and physical fabrication processes. We will use Google SketchUp, 3D Printing, and the woodshop to complete a series of small projects. This class combines hands-on exploration with theoretical discussions about tangible media. Quizzes will be held regularly on readings and lecture material. There will be an emphasis in this class on creating playful machines and participating in the open-source community.

Students will be expected to spend at least 2 hours outside of class each week advancing projects and/or responding to reading material. Assignments must be synced to your individual GitHub repository. You must participate in group discussions and critiques in this course.

## Learning Outcomes
+ The ability to design files for 3d printing using SketchUp
+ Troubleshooting 3d print design problems (normals, holes, etc)
+ A basic understanding of the wood shop and how to build simple objects
+ A basic understanding of designing for laser cutting
+ The ability to program microcontrollers for user input and motor control
+ The ability to solder, wire, and enclose projects
+ A general understanding and practice of the iterative design process

## Attendance
Punctuality is one of the most respected virtues in the industry. If you have a reputation for showing up on time, you will always find people willing to trust you and to hire you. Use this class as an opportunity to build the habit of punctuality. It will be very difficult for you to learn the material if you are not in class. If you must come in late, please be respectful of the class and try not to disturb anyone as you enter. If you know ahead of time that you will be late or absent, please contact me before the start of class so we can arrange for you to make up material you will be missing.

Please refer to the latest student handbook for the university-wide policy on attendance.
