## Print Updated Chassis

## Test Drive, for real

+ In lieu of completed chassis, we can use hacked Lego motors and cardboard to get everything up and running. This will validate wiring and bluetooth connections. 

## Control

+ Think through your controller interface. What makes sense as a set of instructions for Processing to send to Arduino via bluetooth?

+ Do you want to add any automated controls?

+ Do you want to add sensors that impact the car's behavior?
