# Physical Computing / Projection Mapping / Fabrication

The first half has to be about projection mapping

Signal flow:
1. Arduino interpretting analog reading from potentiometer
2. Arduino sends converted value (byte) over Serial
3. MAX/MSP (or Processing) reads incoming Serial data

Ideas:
+ VJing
	+ strobing / pulsing
	+ changing colors
+ Unity
	+ change speed at which blocks fall
+ Projection mapping
	+ Corner pinning
+ Smart objects~
	+ Project down onto a space that has a potentiomer, scrolling the pot projects an increasing arc. Or project just above it so that my hand doesn't interrupt
	+ Live color mixing
