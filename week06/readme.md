## Project 1: Chassis

+ We will be building simple electronic vehicles. The first step is to design a chassis that can support two DC motors. 
+ I've included a SketchUp file with a digital replica of the DC motor we are going to use. I suggest you use it to construct your chassis.
	+ [dc-motor.skp](dc-motor.skp)
+ I've also included a PDF of the motor dimensions if you prefer to operate from that.
	+ [motor-specsheet.pdf](motor-specsheet.pdf)

+ This is intended to improve your SketchUp skills through practice. You should expect to run into several issues along the way. Persist! This will be a graded assignment. Your file should be 3d-printable, which means there should be no erroneous holes, and all of the normals (or faces) should be facing outwards.
	+ The following resources will help you
		+ [SketchUp official tutorials](https://www.sketchup.com/learn)
		+ [8 tips for 3d print designing in SketchUp](https://mastersketchup.com/8-tips-for-3d-printing-with-sketchup/)
		+ [unofficial sketchup for 3d modeling tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPQliNKJKto)

+ I made a sketch of a plausible design, which you can feel free to work from:
