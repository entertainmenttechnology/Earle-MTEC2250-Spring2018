# MTEC 2250: Fabrication for Physical Computing

# Generally speaking, 2250 should be more basic electronics, not necessarily Arduino-based in all aspects, soldering, recycling old gear, kinetic sculptures. 2280 is more about interfacing Arduino with Processing, talking about CV, Kinect, robot arms

## Learning Objectives

	+ A basic understanding of gears
	+ An understanding of the following components:
		+ DC motors
		+ Servo motors

	+ How to connect and solder electronic components
	+ How to utilize 3d printing and thingiverse.com to interface with gears and motors
	+ SketchUp?
