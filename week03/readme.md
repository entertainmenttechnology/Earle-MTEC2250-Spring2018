## Turn in

+ Keychains, let's print!

## Demo

+ Arduino light switch

## Exercise

+ Augment something in the room using 3d printing. This can be an artistic intervention, pure utility, or a gamification of the environment. 
+ Measure the object you are augmenting using calipers, etc.
+ Design a fitted object for it inside of SketchUp
+ Be intentional about your creation. You might make a mistake which you only realize after printing. It takes a bit of practice.
