# Week 3

+ [Pirate Pad](http://piratepad.net/8obaXxyr72)

## Turn in

+ Keychains, let's print!

## Relevant Projects & Artists

+ [3d printed voice signatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBxvsxSoiiQ)
+ [3d printed non-vinyl record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQi8FUsZ8OY)

## Demo

+ Arduino light switch
+ SketchUp: Precision

## Exercise

+ Augment something in the room using 3d printing. This can be an artistic intervention, pure utility, or a gamification of the environment. 
	+ Measure the object you are augmenting using calipers, etc.
	+ Design a fitted object for it inside of SketchUp
	+ Be intentional about your creation. You might make a mistake which you only realize after printing. It takes a bit of practice.

## Homework due next week

+ Use SketchUp to design an experimental gaming controller (speculative futurist designs also welcome).
	+ You must choose from the following objects, so design accordingly!
		+ [100mm massive arcade button](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1186)
		+ [30mm arcade button](https://www.adafruit.com/product/473)
		+ [16mm push button](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1503)
		+ [Small arcade joystick](https://www.adafruit.com/product/480)
		+ [2-axis joystick](https://www.adafruit.com/product/245)
		+ [Potentiometer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/562)
		+ [Long flex sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/182)
		+ [Small microphone](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1064)
		+ [Heartbeat/pulse sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1093)
		+ [Infrared distance sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1031)
		+ [Temperature/humidity sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/385)
		+ [Circular touch sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1069)
		+ [Air quality sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3686)
	+ Create and upload the STL file to your repository. Create a directory just for this assignment with the name 'experimental_controller'. Add a 4-6 sentence description (as a readme.md file in the same directory as your STL)
	+ Be precise about your sizing. This will be graded on how well the parts fit.
	+ Feel free to propose strange designs, but keep it somewhat feasible.
