+ Read [Disobedient Electronics](http://www.disobedientelectronics.com/resources/Hertz-Disobedient-Electronics-Protest-201801081332c.pdf) and write a response to 3 projects that you find interesting. You can be critical of the projects as well. Put your response in a folder in your repo titled "responses" and name the file "disobedient_electronics". It can be a doc, odt, md, or pdf file.
	+ Pay special attention to the fabrication techniques involved. Does that affect the way you feel about the project? What about the physical form do you find interesting? Did this project generate some new ideas for you?
